# UFEDMapper
UFEDMapper is a Python script crafted to process and visualize KML files exported from Cellebrite UFED [^1] using Plotly [^2]. This tool generates various types of interactive map visualizations from the extracted data points. Based on [UFEDkml2map](https://github.com/ot2i7ba/UFEDkml2map/), this script has been tailored to meet my professional needs, helping me streamline my workflow. By sharing this, I hope it can also be beneficial to others in similar fields.

   git clone https://github.com/ot2i7ba/UFEDMapper.git
   cd UFEDMapper
   ```

2. **To install the required dependencies, use the following command:**:

   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the script**:
   ```sh
   python UFEDMapper.py
   ```

# Usage
1. Place your KML file in the same directory as the script.
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python UFEDMapper.py
   ```
3. Follow the prompts to select a KML file, choose plot types, and enter optional filters.

## Follow the Prompts
- **KML File Selection**: The script will search the directory for KML files and present a numbered list for selection.
- **Prefix for Output Files**: Enter a prefix for the output files (optional).
- **Date Range Filtering**: Optionally filter data points by entering a date range.
- **Plot Types**: Choose one or more plot types for visualization.

## Plot Types
The user can choose between the Plotly and Folium plotting libraries. The following plot types are available:
- **Scatter Plot**: Visualize data points on a map.
- **Heatmap**: Show density of data points.
- **Lines Plot**: Connect data points with lines.
- **Circle Markers**: Visualize data points with circle markers.
- **Polygon**: Draw polygons connecting data points.

# PyInstaller
To compile the UFEDMapper script into a standalone executable, you can use PyInstaller. Follow the steps below:

1. Install PyInstaller (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   pip install pyinstaller
   ```

2. Compile the script using the following command:
   ```bash
   pyinstaller --onefile --name UFEDMapper --icon=ufedmapper.ico --hidden-import pyarrow --hidden-import pyarrow.vendored.version UFEDMapper.py
   ```

- `--onefile`: Create a single executable file.
- `--name UFEDMapper`: Name the executable UFEDMapper.
- `--icon=ufedmapper.ico`: Use ufedmapper.ico as the icon for the executable.
- `--hidden-import pyarrow`: Ensure that the pyarrow module is included.
- `--hidden-import pyarrow.vendored.version`: Ensure that the pyarrow.vendored.version module is included.

3. Find the executable in the dist directory.

## Using UFEDMapper.spec
Alternatively, you can use the provided UFEDMapper.spec file to compile the script.

1. Compile the script using the spec file:
   ```bash
   pyinstaller UFEDMapper.spec
   ```

2. Find the executable in the dist directory.

**Running the executable**: After compilation, you can run the executable found in the dist directory.

## Releases
A compiled and 7zip-packed version of UFEDMapper for Windows is available as a release. You can download it from the **[Releases](https://github.com/ot2i7ba/UFEDMapper/releases)** section on GitHub. This version includes all necessary dependencies and can be run without requiring Python to be installed on your system.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> An internet connection is required to display the maps in the generated HTML files. This is because the maps are rendered using Plotly, which relies on online resources to load the map tiles and other visualization components. Rest assured, no information from your local system is sent to Plotly during this process. The map data is sourced from OpenStreetMap [^3], ensuring compliance with GDPR regulations.

# Example

## The script lists available KML files and prompts for selection:
```
Available KML files:
1. Example.kml
2. Locations.kml
e. Exit
Enter the number of the desired KML file (Enter to use 'Locations.kml' or 'e' to exit):
```

## After selecting a file, the script prompts for a prefix for the output files:
```
Enter a prefix for the output files (optional):
```

## Optionally filter data by date range:
```
Enter start date (DD.MM.YYYY) or press Enter to skip:
Enter end date (DD.MM.YYYY) or press Enter to skip:
```

## Choose one or more plot types for visualization:
```
Choose one or more plot types (e.g., 1,2,5):
1. Scatter Plot
2. Heatmap
3. Lines Plot
4. Circle Markers
5. Polygon
```

# Logging
The log file UFEDMapper.log will be created in the same directory as the script.

# Conclusion
This script has been tailored to fit my specific professional needs, and while it may seem like a small tool, it has a significant impact on my workflow. By automating the visualization of KML files from Cellebrite UFED, UFEDMapper saves me time and effort, allowing me to focus on more critical tasks. Greetings to my dear colleagues [^4] who avoid scripts like the plague and think that consoles and Bash are some sort of dark magic â€“ the [compiled](https://github.com/ot2i7ba/UFEDMapper/releases) version will spare you the console kung-fu and hopefully be a helpful tool for you as well. ðŸ˜‰
